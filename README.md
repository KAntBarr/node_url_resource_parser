# node_url_resource_parser

## Description
This program allows for a user to search for a http resource and print out the data of that resource. If the resource is detected to be a text file, then each line will be printed out one at a time at a default one second pace. If the resource is not a text file, then every 16 bytes will get printed out at a one second pace. The program can be sped up, slowed down, paused, and the user can quit midway.
